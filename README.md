#  Traffic Flow Prediction Using Bayesian Networks

A machine learning project that applies **Bayesian Networks** to predict traffic flow. Developed using **Python**, this project demonstrates the power of probabilistic graphical models for time-series forecasting in traffic management.

---

##  Overview

This project focuses on using **Bayesian Networks** to:

1. Load and preprocess traffic data (e.g., snapshots of vehicle counts over time).
2. Define and train a dynamic Bayesian Network model to capture dependencies.
3. Predict future traffic flow based on learned conditional probabilities.
4. Analyze prediction results using metrics like MSE and log-likelihood.

**Key contributions:**
- Data preprocessing routines
- Model specification using `pgmpy`
- Training and inference for traffic prediction
- Visualizations of predictions vs ground truth
